# Embedding Matchmaking

_"Words can't describe how unique your interests are... but coordinates can" - Sean Ashley, circa 2023_

A flattened embedding space of names clustered based on their interests using the sentence-transformers all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model. Created for the UW Startups S23 Kickoff event with guidance from [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/) and [Sean Ashley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-ashley). [Simha Kalimipalli](https://github.com/Simha-Kalimipalli) later aded interactivity!
