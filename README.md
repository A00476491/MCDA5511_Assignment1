New Data
Sriram Ramesh: I hate Competitive coding, playing soccer, table tenis
Sukanta Dey Amit: I love watching documentaries, reading books and playing cricket.
Max Zhao: I hate sports and enjoy exploring all sorts of AI models

The first classmate’s response has been completely changed by replacing “love” with “hate”. For, the second two classmates, the response has been changed slightly by using synonym of the words used. For example, “movies” has been replaced with documentaries, and “kinds” has been replaced with “sorts”. Therefore, the cosine result after running the file was quite accurate.

Cosine similarity for Sukanta Dey Amit 0.934491
Cosine similarity for Max Zhao 0.996735
